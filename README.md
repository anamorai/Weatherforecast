# Weatherforecast

I was required to create a 5 Day Weather forecast that retrieved weather data for cities that:

* Had a dashboard with form inputs.
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
  * When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
* Present a series of prompts for password criteria
* Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Installation

To open the project please follow this link: https://anamorai.github.io/Password-Generator/
## Usage 

Once you open the URL, you will see the following:

By clicking on the 'Generate Password' button you will see a series of prompts. It will look like this:

If you were to enter in something incorrectly, I have programmed an alert. It will look like this:

Once you have completed all prompts, a password will be generated for you. It will look like this:
