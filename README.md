# Weatherforecast

I was required to create a 5 Day Weather forecast that retrieved weather data for cities that:

* Has a dashboard with form inputs.
* Allows a user to search for a city and then see the current weather conditions for that city.
* Allows a user to view future weather conditions for that city and are presented with a 5-day forecast 
* Allows a user to click on a city in the search history and are again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Installation

I would also like to reference W3Schools for the plethora of information that I have been able to learn from. I would also like to give credit to my tutors for guiding me in this project and being a great support.
